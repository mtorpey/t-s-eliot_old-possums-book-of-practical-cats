			<h2 epub:type="title">Mending Wall</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spills the upper boulders in the sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The work of hunters is another thing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have come after them and made repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where they have left not one stone on a stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one has seen them made or heard them made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But at spring mending-time we find them there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on a day we meet to walk the line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set the wall between us once again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We keep the wall between us as we go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To each the boulders that have fallen to each.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some are loaves and some so nearly balls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have to use a spell to make them balance:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stay where you are until our backs are turned!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We wear our fingers rough with handling them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh, just another kind of out-door game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One on a side. It comes to little more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There where it is we do not need the wall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is all pine and I am apple orchard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My apple trees will never get across</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He only says, “Good fences make good neighbours.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I could put a notion in his head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“<em>Why</em> do they make good neighbours? Isn’t it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before I built a wall I’d ask to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What I was walling in or walling out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to whom I was like to give offence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something there is that doesn’t love a wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wants it down.” I could say “Elves” to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But it’s not elves exactly, and I’d rather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said it for himself. I see him there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He moves in darkness as it seems to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not of woods only and the shade of trees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will not go behind his father’s saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he likes having thought of it so well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He says again, “Good fences make good neighbours.”</span>
